# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview

For this project a data set from Amazon reviews for video games was selected for analysis to determine whether there is a favorable review bias from Vine members versus non-Vine members.  To accomplish this, Pyspark was used to perform the ETL process by extracting the data, transforming the data, and connecting to teh database that was generated through the webserver

## Results

### How many Vine Reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
